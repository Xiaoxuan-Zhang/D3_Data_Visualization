# A visualization with D3
  
  Controls: Mouse over or click on each planet to see everyday data, or click on the title to see all data.  
  
  This is a class assignment.
  The design purpose is to get a sense of the amount of time I spend using my iphone every week because I know it's really unproductive to check my phone all the time, almost compulsively. Anyways, I tracked my cellphone usage for a whole week using an app called 'Moment-Screen Time Tracker'. Then I used seven planets to represent seven days in a week respectively, known as 金，木，水，火，土. The area of the main body of each planet indicates the time not being wasted, while the light gray dots orbiting around indicate the time being wasted. The further the grey dot is from the center, the more time has been wasted on my phone. If you think of time as energy, then the scattered dots are portions of energy being emitted from the source, the planet. It's a metaphor.  
  You can tell from the position of the dot on its orbit on what time of the day I turned to my phone. You can also know from the size of that dot how long this action lasted. 
  
  Give it a try ---->
